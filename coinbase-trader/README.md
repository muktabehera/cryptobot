## Price action:
- Price action represents collective human behavior
- Price Action helps reduce market “noise” and false signals

- multi-timeframe trading
    - trade in smaller timeframes by using trading setups that happen in larger timeframes.
    
- trade when the odds are in your favour
 
-  price action trading is about understanding the psychology of the market using those patterns and making a profit as a result.

### Note:

- You don’t want to be buying near or at a resistance level (which is a reversal point).
- You don’t want to be selling at near or at a support level (which is a reversal point).
- You don’t want be buying when the trend is down and you don’t want to be selling when the trend is up 
 
> In an uptrend, look to buy on the downswing. In a downtrend, look to sell on an upswing.

- **Significant support and resistance levels** are those levels that are formed in the large timeframes like the monthly, weekly and daily charts.

#### The technique to trade setups that happen in larger timeframes:

Switch to smaller timeframes like the 4hr & the 1hr, 30min, 15min and even the 5min and wait for a reversal candlestick signal for trade entries. This is so that we can get in at a much better price level as well as reducing stop loss distance.
